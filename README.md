# Scheduling-Import

The attached excel file is one that I worked with the scheduling and business systems teams to create. It brings in information about scheduled assemblies and their shortages through SQL connected sheets to the ERP database. This information is then put through a series of functions in excel on the sheet titles “CLEAN” to generate the information necessary to import the data to the ERP system for manufacturing schedule creation. 

This document allowed for 100% of shortages shown in the system to be scheduled with total production time calculated into the component due date, as well as pertinent information for the production personnel such as next operation location.

By using this document, the scheduling process for component manufacturing was reduced to 1.5 hours a week from the previously estimated 30 hours a week that component scheduling took before( an estimated $58,000). This allowed the scheduling team to be proactive in working with sales and manufacturing about timelines and priorities to smooth the production process.
